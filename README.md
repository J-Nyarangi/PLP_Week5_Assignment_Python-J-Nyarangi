# PLP_Week5_Assignment_Python-J-Nyarangi

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as class design, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Assignment 1: Smartphone Class

### Description
Models a smartphone with attributes like brand, model, storage, and battery life.

### Features
- **Smartphone**: Base class with basic functionality.
- **GamingSmartphone**: Inherits from Smartphone and adds GPU and gaming-specific methods.

### Usage
- View specifications of smartphones.
- Simulate calling or gaming activities.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles

### Description
Explores polymorphism by modeling different vehicles with a common action `move()`.

### Features
- **Vehicle**: Abstract base class.
- Subclasses (**Car**, **Plane**, **Boat**) implement their own `move()` methods.

### Usage
- Demonstrates how different vehicles perform the same action differently.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Copy the code into a `.py` file and run it.
3. Observe the outputs and explore the flexibility of OOP principles.
